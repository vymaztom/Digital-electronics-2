## Experiments on your own

1. Connect five LEDs to the microcontroller, modify `02-leds` code, and program an application that will ensure that only one of LED is switched on at a time according in [Knight Rider style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-P-2LdS6zk).

2. Simulate the Knight Rider application in SimulIDE.

Extra. Program the [PWM generator](https://www.analogictips.com/pulse-width-modulation-pwm/) using the delay library. Let the duty cycle of the PWM signal be changed continuously and the signal is connected to one of the LEDs. How does a change of duty cycle affect the brightness of an LED?


## Lab assignment
